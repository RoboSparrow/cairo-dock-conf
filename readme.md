Backup of [Cairo dock] theme for Fedora/Cinnamon. I am just tired of customising this every time again when setting up a new machine. 
I don't think this is much useful for others.

* Caro-Dock 3.4.0
* Based on the excellent Humanity-Dock theme by Andrea Calabr√≤ (MastroPino).


### Install

* place in ~/.config/cairo-dock/themes
